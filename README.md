# Excel-Data-Visualisation

## Introduction
I used to hate Excel. I remeber at school feeling like the only thing I could do with it was make graphs. Pointless ones at that. It wasn't until I joined Amazon and started *needing* to use Excel that I fast started discovering how easy it was to use and how making dashboards could paint a better picture of a data set.

## Examples
* Skype Communication Data
While COVID-19 ran rampant and no-one had a clue what to do, I was unable to see my daughter for about 4 months (Not through Government advice I might add) I was looking for a way to  create a dashboard from some kind of meaningful data and something that I would be able to refence from when i needed to. This would be my first attempt at creating an Excel Dashboard.

* ACME Sales Dashboard
Another attempt at creating a dashboard. This time was for sales data from the ficticious company AMCE. Improved formatting and an overall better design turned this dashboard into something that I'm quite proud of.
